## MAGIC: Malware Behaviour Analysis and Impact Quantification through Signature Co-occurrence and Regression

The dataset includes limited samples, which include sample identifier, signature identifier, mark count, and signature severity score, along with the impact score computed using our scoring method.

- **_dataset-103_sample_ - File consists of Signature Scores of 100 ransomware samples**

- **_hash_map_ - File maps Hash id, SHA256 HASH of ransomware samples with labels obtained from AV engines** 

- **_signatures_ - File provides consolidated signature details along with id**
